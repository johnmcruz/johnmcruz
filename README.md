# Superstore Tableau Analysis, Portfolio
In an effort to exercise my Tableau skills, I've been analyzing various data types associated with a fictional superstore.

I got the idea by roaming the internet for random datasets that best lend themselves to the analysis I want to showcase.

If interested, here is where I got the dataset --

I also manipulated the datasets in R for easier analysis, I've attached those scripts to my profile. 

Finally, the Tableau dashboards can be accessed via this link --

Any/all feedback is greatly appreciated!
