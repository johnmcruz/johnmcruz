In an effort to exercise my Tableau skills, I've been analyzing various data associated with a fictional superstore.

I got the idea by roaming the internet for random datasets that best lend themselves to the analysis I want to showcase.

If interested, here is where I got the dataset --

I also manipulated the datasets in R, I've attached those datasets to my profile. 

Finally, the Tableau dashboards can be accessed via this link --
